# Railway Monorepo Configuration
#
# This project uses a monorepo structure with separate backend and frontend services.
# Each service has its own railway.toml configuration file:
#   - backend/railway.toml (Backend API service)
#   - frontend/railway.toml (Frontend SvelteKit service)
#
# DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# 1. Create a new Railway project from your GitHub repository
#
# 2. Add a PostgreSQL database:
#    - Click "+ New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
#    - Railway will auto-generate DATABASE_URL
#
# 3. Deploy Backend Service:
#    - Click "+ New" → "GitHub Repo" → Select this repository
#    - In service settings, set "Root Directory" to: backend
#    - In service settings, set "Watch Paths" to: backend/**
#    - Railway will use backend/railway.toml and backend/Dockerfile
#    - Add environment variables (see env.railway.example)
#    - Link the PostgreSQL database (Variables → Add Reference)
#    - Generate a public domain and copy the URL
#
# 4. Deploy Frontend Service:
#    - Click "+ New" → "GitHub Repo" → Select this repository
#    - In service settings, set "Root Directory" to: frontend
#    - In service settings, set "Watch Paths" to: frontend/**
#    - Railway will use frontend/railway.toml and frontend/Dockerfile
#    - Set environment variables:
#      * VITE_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.up.railway.app
#      * VITE_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://your-backend.up.railway.app/ws/stories
#      * ORIGIN=https://your-frontend.up.railway.app
#    - Generate a public domain
#
# 5. Configure CI/CD:
#    - Railway automatically deploys on git push
#    - Watch paths ensure only relevant services rebuild
#
# For detailed instructions, see: RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md
#
# NOTE: This root railway.toml is for documentation only.
# Railway uses the service-specific railway.toml files in backend/ and frontend/
